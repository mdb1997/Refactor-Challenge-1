# Refactor-Challenge-1

##Description

This project was built to improve an active Horiseon website with the criteria of creating a cleaner code and fixing an inaccessible link. This new code solves the broken Search Engine Optimization and made it accessible to users. This new code also provides a cleaner CSS style sheet and semantic HTML. During this project, I learned how to problem-solve and how to write cleaner code.
